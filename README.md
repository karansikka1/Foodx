# iFood 2018 Challenge @ [FGVC5](https://sites.google.com/view/fgvc5/home), [CVPR 2018](http://cvpr2018.thecvf.com/)
Being able to automatically identify the food items in an image can assist towards food intake monitoring to maintain a healthy diet. Food classification is a challenging problem due to the large number of food categories, high visual similarity between different food categories, as well as the lack of datasets that are large enough for training deep models. In this competition, we introduce a new dataset of 211 fine-grained (prepared) food categories with 101733 training images collected from the web. We provide human verified labels for both the validation set of 10323 images and the test set of 24088 images. The goal is to build a model to predict the fine-grained food-category label given an image.

The main challenges are:

* Fine-grained Classes: The classes are fine-grained and visually similar. For example, the dataset has 15 different types of cakes, and 10 different types of pastas.

* Noisy Data: Since the training images are crawled from the web, they often include images of raw ingredients or processed and packaged food items. This is refered to as cross-domain noise. Further, due to the fine-grained nature of food-categories, a training image may either be incorrectly labeled into a visually similar class or be annotated with with a single label despite having multiple food items. 

This competition is part of the fine-grained visual-categorization workshop ([FGVC5 workshop](https://sites.google.com/view/fgvc5/home)) at [CVPR 2018](http://cvpr2018.thecvf.com/). Individuals/teams with top submissions will present their work as a poster at the FGVC5 workshop. We are offering cash-prizes to the top three entries (sponsored by SRI International).

1st prize: $500

3rd prize: $200

## Evaluation Server
The challenge is hosted on [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/c/ifood2018)

The training data consists of 101733 images from 211 classes. The training data is collected from web images and consists of noisy labels.

### Validation Data
The validation data consists of 10323 images from 211 classes. The test data is collected from web images and the labels are human verified. It does not contain noisy labels.

### Test Data
The training data consists of 24088 images from 211 classes. The test data is collected from web images and the labels are human verified. It does not contain noisy labels.

## Data Download and Format
# This project is deprecated. Please refer to the 2019 [version](https://github.com/karansikka1/iFood_2019/) of this challenge and data. 
[Annotations](https://github.com/karansikka1/iFood_2019/) (2.6 MB)
* Running `md5sum annot.tar` on the tar file should produce `1580c3d24167c7b7a2f297903757805d`
* The tar contains 4 files
     * class_list.txt: Contains the names of 211 class labels. This can be used to map class_ids with class names.
     * train_info.csv: Each line of this csv containing the "image_name,label" pair for training data. For example, "train_00000.jpg,94" refers to image train_00000.jpg having class_id 94. The class_id can be mapped to class name using class_list.txt.      
     * val_info.csv: Each line of this csv containing the "image_name,label" pair for validation data.
     * test_info.csv: csv only provides the list of test images.
 * We provide separate tars for train, val and test images as mentioned below.

[Train Images](https://github.com/karansikka1/iFood_2019/) (2 GB)
* Running `md5sum train.tar` on the tar file should produce `8a8b099e158800f2bb4883992ef35230`
* Contains training images.
* For label information see annotation file train_info.csv. 

[Validation Images](https://github.com/karansikka1/iFood_2019/) (200 MB)
* Running `md5sum val.tar` on the tar file should produce `51d666f9ab34833c117dfe6c06e3bec3`
* Contains validation images.
* For label information see annotation file val_info.csv. 

[Test Images](https://github.com/karansikka1/iFood_2019/) (467 MB)
* Running `md5sum train.tar` on the tar file should produce `d7b89119c434b4b01868b7307cc22a94`
* Contains testing images.
* The label will be evaluation on the evaluation server.

## Evaluation
We follow a similar metric to the classification tasks of the [ILSVRC](http://image-net.org/challenges/LSVRC/2016/index#scene). For each image <img src="https://rawgit.com/visipedia/inat_comp/master/svgs/77a3b857d53fb44e33b53e4c8b68351a.svg?invert_in_darkmode" align=middle width=5.642109pt height=21.60213pt/>, an algorithm will produce 3 labels <img src="https://rawgit.com/visipedia/inat_comp/master/svgs/655bedbaf4a65f397b5041d0fdecde4c.svg?invert_in_darkmode" align=middle width=15.601905pt height=22.74591pt/>, <img src="https://rawgit.com/visipedia/inat_comp/master/svgs/946e592e2b2753a9272767ae3dd5b9a9.svg?invert_in_darkmode" align=middle width=82.4274pt height=21.60213pt/>. For this competition each image has one ground truth label <img src="https://rawgit.com/visipedia/inat_comp/master/svgs/681a37b53b66acbc455e39ca3e6f1c41.svg?invert_in_darkmode" align=middle width=12.444795pt height=14.10255pt/>, and the error for that image is:
<p align="center"><img src="https://rawgit.com/visipedia/inat_comp/master/svgs/7a42826f81c53c77e0fef3c827238d25.svg?invert_in_darkmode" align=middle width=123.403665pt height=24.865665pt/></p>

The overall error score for an algorithm is the average error over all <img src="https://rawgit.com/visipedia/inat_comp/master/svgs/f9c4988898e7f532b9f826a75014ed3c.svg?invert_in_darkmode" align=middle width=14.94405pt height=22.38192pt/> test images:

## Submission File Format
```
image_name,label1 label2 label3 
test_0001.jpg,0 1 10 
test_0002.jpg,1 3 5 
test_0003.jpg,0 5 1 
```

Please include the header as shown above for correct parsing. Each line will correspond to one test image and will be identified by the id (e.g test_0001.jpg refers to image test_0001.jpg) for computing accuracy.

## Rules

* Participants should use only the provided training and validation images for training models. Validation data should only be used for validation. 
* We do not allow augmentation with any prior datasets or additional data during training. Pretraining with additional data (such as ImageNet) is allowed as long as participants do not actively collect additional data for the target categories in iFood 2018 challenge. 
Use of any external data should be properly acknowledged and cited. The general rule is that we want participants to use only the provided training and validation images to train a model to classify the test images.
* Collecting additional annotations for the train images is not allowed. 
* Hand labeling of test data is not allowed and will lead to disqualification.
